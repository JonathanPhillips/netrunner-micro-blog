Just jacked into the Micro.blog neural network. The interface is clean, the connection is stable, and the corporate surveillance is... well, it's Micro.blog, so minimal.

Testing the cyberpunk theme deployment. All systems showing green. The terminal aesthetic is holding up well in the blog format.

Current status:
- âœ… Theme deployed successfully
- âœ… Political solidarity badges displaying correctly  
- âœ… Music player functional
- ðŸ”„ Still tweaking the activity monitor visualization

Time to start documenting the resistance. More entries incoming.
