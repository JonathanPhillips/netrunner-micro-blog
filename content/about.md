Cloud infrastructure wrangler by day, vintage clothing archaeologist by night. I automate everything that doesn't move and some things that do.

Currently obsessed with: Japanese Americana, finding the perfect vintage Levi's, Paraboot Michaels, and making AI do things it probably shouldn't.

When not wrestling with k8s clusters or writing Python scripts, I'm digging through vintage clothing on eBay, spinning vinyl, or watching I Think You Should Leave for the 200th time.

Building tools for digital independence. Making the web weird again. Privacy advocate. Leftist. Fighting the Fascists.
